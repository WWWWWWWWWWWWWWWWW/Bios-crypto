stopped at ecc start...

must have for v1.16
- merge PKCS #1 v1.5 back in, document changes to rsa_encrypt and rsa_sign
- document PK build flags
- document makefile flags [INSTALL_* for instance]
- clean up manual, add examples, add xcbc, f9, fix grammar
- prepare manual for printing (both soft and hard cover)

Nice to have [in order of precedence]
- Add ECC double-mult-add to plugin and make optional accelerator for baseline and MECC_FP [two goals]
- add X9.63 IES
- add CPP macros like OpenSSL has for ASN1 (e.g. encode/decode functions, etc) shameless ripoff :-)
